## Note:
### About Ropsten Test Networking
Ropsten Test Network is the Ethereum Ropsten Testnet I’ve been alluding to in this learning experience. Smart contracts deployed here are live and visible to the world. Developers use these test networks to ensure their contract will behave as expected in the Main Ethereum Network, which is the real Ethereum blockchain.

### How to get fake Eth
With the Ropsten Test Network selected, we’ll request some fake ether from this site [this site](https://faucet.metamask.io/). Click the ‘request 1 ether from faucet’ button and it’ll create a transaction to deliver some fake cryptocurrency to your Metamask account. I usually click it a few times so I have enough ether as I test my application.
